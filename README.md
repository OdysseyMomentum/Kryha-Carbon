Let us introduce you to Charles. (Solution + potential)
Charles will empower you. It helps both consumers and companies to make more informed purchase decisions. This will drive sustainable industry change through market dynamics.

Charles allows companies to report and audit their emissions. Experts to benchmark the companies. And consumers to access a product passport including carbon footprint rating.

Charles facilitates both positive consumer behavior change and company supply chain optimization.

So how does it work?m (USP’s)
Charles has 3 layers that all come together and become a powerful and versatile industry-agnostic tool. 

On the first layer, we have reporting. This enables organizations to easily timestamp their environmental impact reports. Blockchain technology verifies data integrity without the need for content access and all the while preserving anonymity.

On the second layer, there’s validation. This layer allows trusted entities like credible NGO’s to audit and validate the content of the reports. 

Lastly, the rating layer. This will enable domain experts such as CDP.net to benchmark organizations within their horizontal supply chain layers. And weight them against their vertical supply chain partners. Stringing together the supply chain to create a product-specific rating in a product passport.
